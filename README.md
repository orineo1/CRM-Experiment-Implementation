# CRM Experiment Software

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the CRM Experiment Software, which is a web application that conducts experiments to determine the appropriate dosage at each stage and identify the drug's Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) based on desired MTD values. The application uses prior probabilities for each dose and employs a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the drug closest to the MTD at each iteration.

## Getting Started

To run the CRM Experiment Software, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Install the required dependencies - using the requirements file 
3. Run the application: app.py
4. Open a web browser and navigate to the link provided by the application, which will be in the format `http://localhost:{4-digit-number}`, to access the application.


## Usage

The application provides a user interface where you can interact with the experiment. The main components of the interface are:

- **Instructions**: This section displays instructions for each step of the experiment.
- **User Input**: Here, you can enter the required information for the experiment, such as the number of doses and the xi values.
- **Output**: This section shows the output of the experiment, including the recommended dosage and the visual output.
- **Visual Output**: This is a bar plot that visualizes the experimental results.

Follow the instructions provided in the application to proceed with the experiment. You will be prompted to enter the required information and submit your answers.
